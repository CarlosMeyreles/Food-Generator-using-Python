# Food-Generator-using-Python

## Objective

I developed a Food Generator application using Python. It helps users decide what to eat by suggesting food options based on selected cuisines (Asian, Italian, and Spanish). If users donâ€™t like the suggestions, the program offers other options until all choices are exhausted, then it suggests that they might not be hungry for that type of cuisine. This project served as an introduction to Python and demonstrated basic interactivity and data handling.

### Skills Learned

- Python Programming Fundamentals: Understanding the syntax and foundational concepts of Python, such as variables, functions, and control structures.
- User Input Handling: Implementing and managing user interactions through prompts and responses, ensuring the program can handle various user inputs.
- Conditional Statements: Effectively using if-else statements to create dynamic and responsive application logic based on user choices

### Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language used to develop the Food Generator application.
- Replit: An online coding platform used to write, test, and share the Python code.
- Random Module: A Python module used to randomly select food options from the list..

## Steps

Problem Definition: The need to create a program that helps foodies choose what to eat by suggesting food options from three cuisines (Asian, Italian, Spanish) was identified.

Solution Planning: Pseudocode was written to outline the program's logic, including user prompts and conditional statements.

Environment Setup: Replit was used to set up the coding environment, and the Python code was initiated.

User Input Handling: Prompts were implemented to ask users if they are hungry and which cuisine they prefer.

Food Options Storage: Lists were used to store food options for each cuisine.

Logic Implementation: If-else statements were utilized to select the appropriate food options based on user input.

Option Iteration: The program looped through the food options, suggesting one at a time, and asked users if they were interested.

Feedback Provision: Messages were displayed based on user responses, suggesting other cuisines if necessary.

Program Testing: The code was run to identify and fix any errors or bugs.

Code Documentation: Comments were added to explain the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

Finalization and Sharing: Ensured the program ran smoothly and shared the Replit link for others to access and use the application.
